[Building a Sec Monitoring Environment w/ Splunk]( ) </br>
</br>
I built a SIEM environment through Splunk then performed the following skills:
<ul>
  <li> Monitored baseline and attack logs from both Windows and Linux servers</li>
  <li> Loaded Windows and Apache logs onto the SIEM </li>
  <li> Created reports, alerts, and dashboards for the Windows and Apache logs</li>
  <li> Installed add-on Splunk applications for additional monitoring</li>
  <li> Created an accompanying slide deck to present my findings</li>
</ul>
