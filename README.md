[Building a Sec Monitoring Environment w/ Splunk](https://github.com/RobertGRussell/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/SIEM%20Environment%20Simulation.pdf) </br>
I built a SIEM environment through Splunk then performed the following skills:
<ul>
  <li> Monitored baseline and attack logs from both Windows and Linux servers</li>
  <li> Loaded Windows and Apache logs onto the SIEM </li>
  <li> Created reports, alerts, and dashboards for the Windows and Apache logs</li>
  <li> Installed add-on Splunk applications for additional monitoring</li>
  <li> Created an accompanying slide deck to present my findings</li>
</ul>

[Cybersecurity Compliance Audit for a Company w/ GAPPS](https://github.com/RobertGRussell/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/GRC_Cybersecurity%20Compliance%20Audit%20for%20Skyler%20Inc..pdf)) </br>
This project's goal was to simulate working with a client to audit their cybersecurity practices and IT infrastructure: 
<ul>

  <li> Adhered to NIST CSFv1.1 (Note: NIST CSFv2.0 was released the Monday following the completion of this project)</li>
  <li> Learned and navigated how to use GAPPS on my own, which is a relatively obscure web tool</li>
  <li> Uploaded and Logged proof of adherence to all types of policies and controls within NIST CSFv1.1, including: </li>
  <ul>
    <li> Anomalies and Events</li>
    <li> Security Continuous Montioring</li>
